# SleepMyMac AppleScript

This is a simple yet effective script to sleep or shutdown your Mac in a given number of minutes.

It works by calling a shell script wich sleeps the whole script / process and will then sleep or shutdown the machine. To abort the running script, you have to kill the process e.g. by cancelling it via the dock item.

Great for watching Netflix or enjoying other media to fall asleep!

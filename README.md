# SleepMyMac AppleScript

This is a simple yet effective script to sleep or shutdown your Mac in a given number of minutes.

It works by calling a shell script wich sleeps the whole script / process and will then sleep (hibernate) or shutdown the machine. To abort the running script, you have to kill the process e.g. by cancelling it via the dock item.

Great for watching Netflix or enjoying other media to fall asleep!

## Installation
Download the .zip file from Github, open _SleepMyMac.applescript_ with AppleScript Editor (default) and export it as an executable program. Safe it somewhere where you like (e.g. /Applications) and you can easily access it via Spotlight.
